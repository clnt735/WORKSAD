# WorkMuna (WORKSAD) 
**Innovating Job Matching in Bayambang, Pangasinan**

WorkMuna is a gamified, full-stack job platform developed for **System Analysis and Design (SAD101)**. It reimagines the traditional job search by using a "swipe-based" interface—similar to modern dating apps—to make connecting employers and job seekers in Bayambang fun, fast, and efficient.

##  Key Innovations

###  Intelligent Matching Algorithm
No more endless scrolling. WorkMuna features a custom matching engine that:
* Analyzes applicant resume details against employer job requirements.
* Calculates a "match score" automatically.
* Shows applicants only the jobs they are qualified for and shows employers only relevant candidates.

###  The "Swipe" Experience
* **Job Seekers:** Swipe right to apply to interesting roles; swipe left to skip.
* **Employers:** Swipe right on candidate profiles that catch your eye; swipe left to move on.

### 📄 Integrated Resume Builder
A built-in tool that allows applicants to generate a professional resume directly within the platform, ensuring their data is perfectly formatted for the matching algorithm.
