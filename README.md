###  Intelligent Matching Algorithm
No more endless scrolling. WorkMuna features a custom matching engine that:
* Analyzes applicant resume details against employer job requirements.
* Calculates a "match score" automatically.
* Shows applicants only the jobs they are qualified for and shows employers only relevant candidates.

###  The "Swipe" Experience
* **Job Seekers:** Swipe right to apply to interesting roles; swipe left to skip.
* **Employers:** Swipe right on candidate profiles that catch your eye; swipe left to move on.

###  Integrated Resume Builder
A built-in tool that allows applicants to generate a professional resume directly within the platform, ensuring their data is perfectly formatted for the matching algorithm.
